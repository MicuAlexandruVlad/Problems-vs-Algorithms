# Dutch National Flag Problem

- It has a time complexity of O(n) because we have to traverse the original list once
- The algorithm works by counting how many 0s, 1s, and 2s there are in the array and stores these values in a dictionary
- The last step is to create the sorted list by appending the 3 values in increasing order, therefore the space complexity is O(n)
- n = length of the array
